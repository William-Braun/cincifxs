# Welcome to the Erickson-Huber Fragile X Center

## Our Goals

Our goals are to advance scientific knowledge about Fragile X syndrome and related disorders, as well as to improve the lives of individuals and families affected by these conditions through research, clinical care, education, and advocacy. Specifically, our primary aim is to:

1. Purpose: Conduct innovative research to better understand the causes and underlying mechanisms of Fragile X syndrome and related disorders, and to develop new and improved diagnostic and treatment strategies for these conditions.
2. Goals: Provide high-quality clinical care to individuals affected by Fragile X syndrome and related disorders, offer education and training opportunities for healthcare professionals, researchers, and students who are interested in Fragile X syndrome and related disorders, and advocate for policies and programs that support individuals and families affected by Fragile X syndrome and related disorders and promote public awareness of these conditions.
